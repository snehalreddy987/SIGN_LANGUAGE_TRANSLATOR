# SIGN_LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR
The Sign Language Translator project leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to interpret and translate hand signs into readable text. The project involves collecting and preprocessing image datasets representing various sign language gestures. Advanced image processing methods and classification algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), are applied to analyze patterns within the visual data. The goal is to build an accurate model capable of real-time recognition and translation of sign language, facilitating seamless communication between individuals with hearing or speech impairments and the broader community.
